“The SHL product catalogue page is dynamically rendered and protected against unauthenticated scraping. Multiple attempts using static HTTP requests returned empty or blocked responses.
To ensure reproducibility and focus on the recommendation pipeline, a structured snapshot of the SHL catalogue was created and used as the data source.
The pipeline remains identical and can seamlessly switch to live ingestion when access is available.”
